I am a PhD student in the [Theory Group](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia advised by [Henry Yuen](https://henryyuen.net/).  I'm interested quantum computing, especially complexity, cryptography and learning theory.  Some specific problems that I think about are QMA versus QMA1, Shadow Tomography, the Complexity of Unitary Synthesis problems, among other problems in Quantum Complexity and Cryptography.

# Teaching
In Fall 2022 I was a TA for __Introduction to Quantum Computing__ at Columbia, taught by Henry Yuen.

# Work Experience
I used to work for a start-up derivatives exchange called [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), where I helped design and build the exchange, as well as designed and built most of the connections with external parties including Bloomberg, brokers, and market makers.   

I also used to work for Citadel on the Alpha Research and Development team.  Some of my projects include X-Alpha (a graph based resource manager for creating terms), and Leonov (a neural architecture that performed better than human modelers on near term alpha).
