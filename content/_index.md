I'm interested quantum computing, especially algorithms and complexity.  Some problems I think about are QCMA vs. QMA, the sample complexity of Shadow Tomography, and things related to QPCP. 

I also work for a novel derivatives exchange called [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), where I helped design and build the exchange.  I currently work in improving the architecture of the exchange, and interfacing with external funds and market makers to design new features, including a FIX API, exchange protections, and performance improvements.  

In a past life I worked for Citadel on the Alpha Research and Development team.  Some of my projects include X-Alpha (a graph based resource manager for creating terms), and Leonov (a neural architecture that performed better than human modelers on near term alpha).
