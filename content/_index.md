I am a PhD student in the [Theory Group](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia advised by [Henry Yuen](https://henryyuen.net/).  I'm interested quantum computing, especially complexity, cryptography and learning theory.  Some specific problems that I think about are QMA versus QMA1, Shadow Tomography, the Complexity of Unitary Synthesis problems, among other problems in Quantum Complexity and Cryptography. 

Before Columbia, I was a graduate student at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, advised by [John Watrous](https://johnwatrous.com/).

# Teaching
In Fall 2022 I was a TA for __Introduction to Quantum Computing__ at Columbia, taught by Henry Yuen.

In Summer 2023 I was a TA for __Topological Aspects of Error Correcting Codes__ at the Park City Mathematics Institute Graduate Summer School, taught by Jeongwan Haah.  Click [here](pcmi) to see the problem sets and solutions.

# Work Experience
I used to work for a start-up derivatives exchange called [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), where I helped design and build the exchange, as well as designed and built most of the connections with external parties including Bloomberg, brokers, and market makers.   

I also used to work for Citadel on the Alpha Research and Development team.  Some of my projects include X-Alpha (a graph based resource manager for creating terms), and Leonov (a neural architecture that performed better than human modelers on near term alpha).
