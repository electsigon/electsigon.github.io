I am a PhD student in the [Theory Group](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia advised by [Henry Yuen](https://henryyuen.net/), and before that I was a graduate student at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, advised by [John Watrous](https://johnwatrous.com/).  I study theoretical computer science, with a focus on quantum computation.

My research is broadly about understanding fully-quantum tasks, including quantum cryptography, unitary complexity theory, and algorithms for learning from quantum data. Some specific problems that I think about are algorithms for shadow tomography, the complexity of unitary synthesis problems, and various topics in quantum cryptography like quantum money and pseudo-randomness. I am generally happy to talk about anything related to computer science, so if you have a question or idea please feel free to reach out to me!

# Teaching
In Fall 2022 I was a TA for __Introduction to Quantum Computing__ at Columbia, taught by Henry Yuen.

In Summer 2023 I was a TA for __Topological Aspects of Error Correcting Codes__ at the Park City Mathematics Institute Graduate Summer School, taught by Jeongwan Haah.  [Click here](pcmi) to see the problem sets and solutions.

# Work Experience
In the summer of 2024, I was an intern at [NTT Research](https://ntt-research.com/cis/) working with [Mark Zhandry](https://mzhandry.github.io/).

I used to work for a start-up derivatives exchange called [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), where I helped design and build the exchange, as well as designed and built most of the connections with external parties including Bloomberg, brokers, and market makers.   

I also used to work for Citadel on the Alpha Research and Development team.  Some of my projects include X-Alpha (a graph based resource manager for creating terms), and Leonov (a neural architecture that performed better than human modelers on near term alpha).  

# Miscellaneous

Here are the slides I used for my [candidacy exam](/pdfs/candidacy/Candidacy_Presentation.pdf) at Columbia.
