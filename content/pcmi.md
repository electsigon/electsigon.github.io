# PCMI: Topological aspects of error correcting codes

[Here](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/pcmi-2023-gss-lecture-notes-and-problem-sets) is the link to the PCMI 2023 lecture notes and problem sets.  The problem sets for the course were originally embedded into the lecture notes, instead of being self-contained.  Here are the problems sets I distributed during the problem sessions, with *select* solutions.  


# Problem sets and solutions
1. Problem set 1: [problem set](/pdfs/PCMI/PCMI_PS1.pdf), [solutions](/pdfs/PCMI/PCMI_PS1_sols.pdf)
2. Problem set 2: [problem set](/pdfs/PCMI/PCMI_PS2.pdf), [solutions](/pdfs/PCMI/PCMI_PS2_sols.pdf)
3. Problem set 3: [problem set](/pdfs/PCMI/PCMI_PS3.pdf), [solutions](/pdfs/PCMI/PCMI_PS3_sols.pdf)
4. Problem set 4: [problem set](/pdfs/PCMI/PCMI_PS4.pdf), [solutions](/pdfs/PCMI/PCMI_PS4_sols.pdf)
